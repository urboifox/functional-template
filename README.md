### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

This project made a difference in my html - css abilities since it's a big project with a lot of sections, that made me search a lot for new stuff to learn.

### Continued development

I will start getting some more information about mastering css and learning SASS since I heard It's much faster and more effecient in time.
